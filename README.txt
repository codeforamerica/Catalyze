----------Catalyze---------

Catalyze is a Civic Matchmaking Service.

We interview people with problems, and match them with civic leaders
& experts who can help get the person out of the problem they are 
experiencing in the city.

The site is built in Drupal 7. This github repository contains
the modules necessary to build and develop the Catalyze system.

There will be a Drush make script for the main Drupal codebase.
This version will contain any specific module versions that are
required for Catalyze.

In the meantime, our Drupal 7 has a few modules installed:

admin advanced help backup_migrate cck coder ctools date devel email 
entity features field_group libraries link markdown openlayers pathauto
 references skinr strongarm token views workbench
